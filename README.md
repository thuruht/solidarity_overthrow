This is a web-based game that simulates a global revolution. The player takes on the role of a revolutionary leader, and their goal is to overthrow the existing world order.

## Architecture

The game is built using the following technologies:

*   **Vite:** A fast and modern build tool for web development.
*   **Leaflet:** An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
*   **Cloudflare Workers:** A serverless platform for running code at the edge.

## Development Process

The development process is as follows:

1.  **Research and planning:** I start by researching best practices and formulating a plan for how to implement a new feature or to refactor existing code.
2.  **Implementation:** I then implement the feature or the refactoring, following the plan that I created.
3.  **Testing:** I test the changes to make sure that they are working correctly.
4.  **Documentation:** I document the changes that I made, including any decisions that I made along the way.
5.  **Committing and pushing:** I commit the changes to git and push them to the remote repository.
